## Architecture

The platform is built using a microservices architecture:

- Gateway Service: API Gateway and request routing
- Auth Service: Authentication and authorization
- Storage Service: File management and S3 operations
- AI Processor: Content analysis and AI processing
- Search Service: Vector search and content discovery
- Realtime Service: Stream processing and real-time updates
